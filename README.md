A little java applet which acts as a clickable button with a nice explode effect

This program is a clear example of what could happen if you don't want to follow the open source movement. During the ages I lost the source code of this program!
The only way to get it again, was to reverse engeneer it (with "jad").

So, I now redistribute this program and change it's licence to GPL, in the hope it will not get lost any more!

Listen to my advice: GIVE THE CODE TO THE PUBLIC!

The old README is only there as documentation. Looks like most of the restrictions applied there are already inside the GNU licence :) And, of course, no matter what the old Readme says, you ARE allowed to see and change the source code!
