Thank you for downloading this Java program
This is my first attempt to write a java program, and I hope that it worths :-)

With this program you can make a hotlink button using java language.


This program is *F*R*E*E* for everyone as long as you keep these simple rules:

1) DON'T charge for it
2) Send me an e-mail if you like it
3) Keep all these files together (except DemoWoW.HTML)
4) If you use it in a commercial program / site first contact me and ask my permission
5) I am not responsible for any hazard this programm will use (although I don't thing it will make any)
6) You don't decompile it and change the code
7) -once more- DON'T charge for it

The files in this archive (WoW.zip) are:
WoW.class       The program
DemoWoW.html    An HTML file, to demostrate the use of this program
readme.txt      This file


The parameters which this applet use in HTML tags are:


 URL            The relative address of the new document
 Target         The browser target window to jump 
 TextDown       Text when mouse button is pressed
 TextUp         Text when mouse button is not presse
 SizePer        Size of inner circle. Number between 0.000 and 1.000
 FontStyle      Style of font (PLAIN, BOLD, ITALIC)
 FontSize       Size of fon
 Peaks          Number of peaks
 FontName       Font to use
 FontCol        Colour of text
 GraphCol       Colour of graph
 BackCol        Colour of the background

You can ommit as many parameters as you want. Then the default parameters will be used.
To set the colours, use this formula:
color = 65536*RED + 256*GREEN + BLUE
where RED, GREEN and BLUE are integer values between 0 and 255.


To see a demo use of this program, look at DemoWoW.html

Thank you
